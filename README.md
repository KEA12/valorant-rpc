## About
  VALORANT Discord Rich-Presence (RPC) gathers real-time ingame information and display it on your Discord Profile, replacing the boring default Discord status! **This is a heavy fork/continuation of [colinhartigan's RPC](https://github.com/colinhartigan/valorant-rpc), which is now unmaintained and archived. This project aims to maintain it and add new features for the forseeable feature.** Unfinished features have been removed, including configuration window and the command line window that appears on run. 
  
Some newly added features and fixes added by me:
  - New Maps & Agents now supported
  - New Gamemodes now supported (Premier ingame functionality not guaranteed, as I haven't had a chance to play Premier with this yet)
  - All icons updated to their latest
  - Automatic updater
  - Custom games now dynamically update their information (agents, gamemode etc)
  - and much more!

## Installation
  - Download the latest [release](https://github.com/KEA12/valorant-rpc/releases/latest)
  - Replace your VALORANT Shortcut with the .exe (to barely change the way you usually launch VALORANT)


## How to use
  - Launch the downloaded .exe instead of VALORANT
  - If VALORANT is already opened, you can still run the .exe and it will overtake your Discord status
  - The program automatically exits once the VALORANT process is closed

## Issues or Problems
  - Make an [issue](https://github.com/KEA12/valorant-rpc/issues) or feel free to open a [pull request](https://github.com/KEA12/valorant-rpc/pulls) :)

## Can I get banned?
  - No! The program does not give you any advantage whatsoever and does not modify the game process or files. You only have access to already known information.
